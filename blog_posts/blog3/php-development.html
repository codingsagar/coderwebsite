      <h3>What is PHP ? Should we learn Php in 2021.</h3>
      <p>
        PHP is the language that can be used to build any kind of websites in
        2021, starting with landing pages and simple WordPress websites, ending
        with complex web platforms like Facebook.The world of the Internet is
        similar to the universe – there might be an end somewhere, but we can’t
        see it. Thousands of new websites are launched each and every day and
        this tendency doesn’t seem to stop. But have you ever wondered how are
        these websites made? When it comes to picking the programming language,
        the choice might be hard to make. There are so many options available on
        the market that you might feel like a child in a candy store.
        Nevertheless, programmers are used to choosing one or two languages to
        stay focused. Admit it, being an expert in one technology is better than
        knowing several ones but on the beginner level. For example, we in
        GBKSOFT have picked PHP as our main technology. You may ask “Why PHP?”.

      <h3>Things you can do using Php:</h3>
      <p>
        Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do
        anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data,
        generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can
        do much more. There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.
        Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target
        field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP parser
        (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to run
        the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access the
        PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through the
        server. All these can run on your home machine if you are just
        experimenting with PHP programming. See the installation instructions
        section for more information. Command line scripting. You can make a PHP
        script to run it without any server or browser. You only need the PHP
        parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts
        regularly executed using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on
        Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing
        tasks. See the section about Command line usage of PHP for more
        information. Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very
        best language to create a desktop application with a graphical user
        interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some
        advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also use
        PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to write
        cross-platform applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP,
        not available in the main distribution. If you are interested in
        PHP-GTK, visit » its own website.
