      <h3>What is HTML ? Why to learn it?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a web-based language that tells
        your browser how to showcase text and images on a webpage. You use tags
        to indicate the various elements, determine the placement of paragraphs,
        headings, add images and videos. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets adds
        styling such as fonts, colours or layouts to your website making the
        website more aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, HTML allows you to build
        the structure of your website and CSS makes that structure come to life.
        Both HTML and CSS are frequently used languages for web development as
        indicated in this chart.Being able to build websites or having an
        understanding of how these languages are utilized can help you build
        optimized, user-friendly websites and without the basics youâ€™ll struggle
        for better results. Not only are you more sought after when it comes to
        web-development but also in industries such as marketing, design and
        advertising.
