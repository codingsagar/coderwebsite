      <h3>What is Android Development ? Why to learn it?</h3>
      <p>
        Android software development is the process by which applications are
        created for devices running the Android operating system. Google states
        that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages"
        using the Android software development kit, while using other languages
        is also possible.All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++
        or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by
        tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages
        and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and
        iOS). Third party tools, development environments, and language support
        have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was
        released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end
        users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well
        as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.
